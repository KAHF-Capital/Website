# Deployment Status - E-book Preview Feature

## Current Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS DEPLOYMENT

### What's Been Added:
1. ✅ EbookPreview.jsx component with full functionality
2. ✅ Payment.jsx updated with preview button
3. ✅ All e-book content pages (1-16, with 13-16 blurred)
4. ✅ Zoom controls and navigation
5. ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

### Deployment Issues:
- **Local Development**: npm not available in current environment
- **Vercel Deployment**: Changes may not be auto-deploying
- **Manual Testing**: Need to verify deployment

### How to Deploy:

#### Option 1: Manual Vercel Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your website project
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
4. Wait for build to complete

#### Option 2: Git Push (if connected to Vercel)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add e-book preview functionality"
git push origin main
```

#### Option 3: Local Testing (if you have Node.js)
```bash
cd Website
npm install
npm start
```

### What to Look For:
1. **Payment Page**: Should show blue "View Preview" button below $19.99
2. **Preview Modal**: Should open with e-book content
3. **Navigation**: Should allow page-by-page browsing
4. **Blurred Pages**: Pages 13-16 should be blurred

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try the HTML test file: `test-preview.html`

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/EbookPreview.jsx` - NEW
- `src/pages/Payment.jsx` - UPDATED
- `test-preview.html` - NEW (for testing)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - NEW

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test the live site
3. Verify preview functionality works
4. Remove debug logging if everything works
