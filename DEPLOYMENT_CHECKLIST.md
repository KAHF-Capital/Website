- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] API key has sufficient permissions and rate limits

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript/JavaScript errors are resolved
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling is implemented for all API calls
- [ ] Loading states are properly implemented
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes

### Testing
- [ ] Dark pool scanner loads without errors
- [ ] API endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Error states display properly
- [ ] Refresh functionality works
- [ ] CSV download works correctly
- [ ] All pages load without JavaScript errors

### Performance
- [ ] Images are optimized
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable (< 1MB)
- [ ] API response times are acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] Vercel account created
- [ ] GitHub repository connected
- [ ] Polygon.io API key ready

#### Deployment Steps
1. **Connect Repository**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `POLYGON_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key`

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

4. **Deploy**
   - Push to main branch or run `vercel --prod`

### 2. Manual Deployment

#### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
export POLYGON_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
export NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Scanner page displays data
- [ ] API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is maintained

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response times < 5 seconds
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs
- [ ] Memory usage is stable

### Security Checks
- [ ] API key is not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled

## 🐛 Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: "Service temporarily unavailable"
**Solution**: Check API key configuration in environment variables

### Issue: "Request timed out"
**Solution**: Verify Polygon.io API rate limits and network connectivity

### Issue: "Internal server error"
**Solution**: Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**: 
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- Ensure Node.js version is compatible

## 📊 Monitoring

### Set up monitoring for:
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] User engagement metrics
- [ ] Server resource usage

### Recommended tools:
- Vercel Analytics
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics for user metrics

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor API usage and rate limits
- [ ] Check for Polygon.io API updates
- [ ] Review error logs weekly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Test all functionality monthly

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Database backups (if using external database)
- [ ] Environment variable backups
- [ ] Code repository backups

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### If the site goes down:
1. Check Vercel status page
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check Polygon.io API status
4. Review recent deployments
5. Rollback to previous version if needed

### Contact Information
- Vercel Support: https://vercel.com/support
- Polygon.io Support: https://polygon.io/support

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### When to scale:
- API rate limits exceeded
- Response times > 5 seconds
- Memory usage > 80%
- Concurrent users > 1000

### Scaling options:
- Upgrade Polygon.io plan
- Implement caching layer
- Add CDN for static assets
- Consider database migration

## ✅ Final Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Monitoring is set up
- [ ] Backup strategy is in place
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Team is notified of deployment
