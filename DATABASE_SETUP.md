# 🗄️ Dark Pool Database Setup

## ✅ **What I Built For You:**

### **1. Daily Tracking System**
- **Saves dark pool data** for every stock every day
- **No estimations** - only real data
- **90-day averages** calculated from actual saved data
- **JSON file storage** (no database installation needed)

### **2. Two Tabs in Scanner**
- **"Top 25 by Dark Pool Activity"** - Shows highest activity stocks
- **"All Tracked Stocks"** - Shows every stock we've ever tracked

### **3. Real 90-Day Averages**
- **Day 1-5**: Shows "Insufficient History" (needs 5+ days of data)
- **Day 6-90**: Shows actual average from saved data
- **Day 90+**: Shows full 90-day rolling average

## 🚀 **What You Need to Do:**

### **Step 1: Start the App**
```bash
cd Website
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Use the Scanner**
1. **First time**: Only "Top 25" tab will have data
2. **Each day**: The app automatically saves dark pool data
3. **After 5 days**: You'll see real 90-day averages
4. **After 90 days**: Full historical tracking

### **Step 3: Watch the Data Grow**
- **Day 1**: Basic list of stocks
- **Day 2-5**: Building history
- **Day 6+**: Real averages vs today's activity
- **Day 90+**: Full 90-day rolling averages

## 📊 **How It Works:**

### **Daily Process:**
1. **Fetches today's dark pool data** from Polygon.io
2. **Saves it to `darkpool-data.json`**
3. **Calculates 90-day average** from saved data
4. **Compares today vs historical average**

### **Data Storage:**
- **File**: `Website/darkpool-data.json`
- **Format**: JSON (human readable)
- **Backup**: You can copy this file to save your data

## 🎯 **What You'll See:**

### **Top 25 Tab:**
- Stocks with highest dark pool activity today
- Real 90-day averages (after 5+ days)
- Activity ratios (today vs 90-day average)

### **All Stocks Tab:**
- Every stock we've ever tracked
- Complete dark pool history
- All data sorted by today's activity

## 🔧 **No Installation Required:**
- **No SQLite** - uses simple JSON files
- **No npm install** - everything included
- **No database setup** - just run the app

## 📈 **Timeline:**
- **Today**: Start tracking
- **Day 5**: First meaningful averages
- **Day 90**: Full historical data
- **Ongoing**: Daily updates, rolling averages

The system will automatically build your dark pool database day by day! 🚀
